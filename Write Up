Description:

1.) Even Number valves must be opened before odd valves
2.) All even must be opened in random order
3.) All odd must open in decreasing order ( in groups of how many wrenches randomly )
4.) Evens can be given priority if the id % magic_num == 0

Running instructions:
$ make
* That compiles and runs

Collaboration:

These were where I got most of my information from. The rest I mostly just knew or had to look up java docs as well.
I basically only used the java docs on oracle.

Problem Areas:

I did not really have any problems. I did get deadlock a couple times by running code before writing the release
statements a few times. But for the most part I thought this was straight forward.
